## 📋 Exercise Requirements

### Exercise 1: Variable Declaration and Initialization

- Declare 5 string variables with proper names
- Initialize each variable with appropriate values
- Display information in the specified format
- **Output labels**: "Personal Information:", "First Name:", "Last Name:",
  "Email:", "Phone:", "Address:"

### Exercise 2: Variable Reassignment

- Create initial character variables
- Reassign variables to show progression over time
- Display character status at each time period
- **Important**: Do NOT reassign the character name

### Exercise 3: String Concatenation

- Build the same sentence using 4 different methods:
  1. `+` operator
  2. `+=` operator
  3. `String.Concat()` method
  4. `String.Join()` with array
- Display each method and result

### Exercise 4: String Interpolation

- Use `$""` syntax for string interpolation
- Format numbers with specific decimal places
- Include conditional expressions in interpolations
- Create multi-line verbatim strings with `@""`

### Exercise 5: String Methods

- Use `Trim()` to remove whitespace
- Use `Replace()` for text substitution
- Use `Contains()`, `IndexOf()`, `StartsWith()`, `EndsWith()` for searching
- Process messy data into clean, formatted output

## ⚠️ Important Rules

### DO

- ✅ Follow the exact variable names specified
- ✅ Complete exercises in order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5)
- ✅ Write code only in designated sections
- ✅ Test your code locally before committing

### DON'T

- ❌ Skip exercises or attempt them out of order
- ❌ Modify the given variables or setup code
- ❌ Change the required output format
- ❌ Remove or modify the template structure

## 🆘 Getting Help

### If Tests Fail

1. 🌐 **Check your web report** for specific error details
2. 💡 **Read the suggestions** - they tell you exactly what to fix
3. 🔍 **Verify your variable names** - they must match exactly
4. 📝 **Check output format** - spaces and capitalization matter
5. 🧪 **Test locally** before committing again

### Common Issues

- **Case sensitivity**: `firstName` ≠ `firstname`
- **Missing spaces**: Check spaces in output strings
- **Wrong labels**: Use "Email:" not "Email Address:"
- **Output format**: Remove emojis from headers

### Report Features
