## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 6.0 or later installed
- Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any C# IDE
- Git for version control

### Setup Instructions

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CSharpStringExercises.git
   cd CSharpStringExercises
   ```

3. **Start with Exercise 1**:
   ```bash
   cd Exercise1
   dotnet run
   ```

## 📖 How to Complete Exercises

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Open Exercise 1 template** (`Exercise1/Exercise1.cs`)
2. **Read the requirements** in the comments carefully
3. **Write your code** in the designated sections marked with:
   ```csharp
   // YOUR CODE HERE - START
   
   // YOUR CODE HERE - END
   ```

   git push origin main
   ```

### 🔄 Automated Testing System

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** for automated testing:

- ✅ **Automatic grading** when you push code
- 📊 **Progress tracking** through all exercises
- 🚫 **Sequential unlocking** - you must pass Exercise 1 to attempt Exercise 2
- 📝 **Detailed feedback** on what needs to be fixed

### Checking Your Progress

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the **"Actions"** tab
3. View the latest workflow run
4. Download the **"test-results"** artifact to see your progress report

## ⚠️ Important Rules

### DO:
- ✅ Follow the exact variable names specified
- ✅ Complete exercises in order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5)
- ✅ Write code only in designated sections
- ✅ Test your code locally before committing

### DON'T:
- ❌ Skip exercises or attempt them out of order
- ❌ Modify the given variables or setup code
- ❌ Change the required output format

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Common Issues:
- **Case sensitivity**: `firstName` ≠ `firstname`
- **Missing spaces**: Check spaces in output strings
- **Wrong method**: Make sure you're using the required string methods
