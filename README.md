# C# String Exercises - Reports

This branch contains the automatically generated HTML reports for the C# String Exercises.

## How it works:

1. Students complete exercises in the main branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically tests their code
3. Beautiful HTML reports are generated and deployed to this branch
4. GitHub Pages serves the reports at: https://joneskwameosei.github.io/working_with_strings/

## Files:

- `index.html` - Main landing page with instructions
- `reports/` - Directory containing all generated reports
- Each report run gets its own subdirectory with timestamp

This page is automatically updated by GitHub Actions.
